        You need to find the index of the left limiting marker (if there is one), the right  limiting marker (again - if there is one in a string),
        and return the text between them.

        How can I find the indixes of these markers?

    <div class="answer">
        Use the 
        <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.find'>str.find() method</a>.

        Could you give an example code?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Sure. But first, note that by using 'find' you'll retrieve the index of the first character of the marker.
        In order to get the index of the first character of the text between the markers, you need to add the length of the left marker.
        <pre class="brush: python">
def between_markers(text: str, begin: str, end: str) -> str:
    begin_index = text.find(begin) + len(begin)
    end_index = text.find(end)</pre>        
    </div>
</div>    

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        How to find the text between the markers?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        By using a slice:
        <pre class="brush: python">        
def between_markers(text: str, begin: str, end: str) -> str:
    begin_index = text.find(begin) + len(begin)
    end_index = text.find(end)
    return text[begin_index:end_index]</pre>
        begin_index - the index of the first character of the text between the markers. end_index - index of the first character of the right marker.
        Since when slicing the symbol at the end_index position is not included in the result, we're getting the needed text.
        In other words, the last character that in fact is a part of our answer is a character at the 'end_index - 1' position, which  
        is the last character of the text between the markers.
    </div>
</div>
    
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        What if one of the markers is missing from the string?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Then you need to start counting from the position 0 (if there is no left marker - begin), or end with the last character
        of the input text (if there is no right marker - end). In case the input string doesn't contain any markers, 
        you should return the whole string as the answer. 
    </div>
</div>
    
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
       Could you explain this in more detail?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Sure.
        <pre class="brush: python">
def between_markers(text: str, begin: str, end: str) -> str:
    if begin in text:
        begin_index = text.find(begin) + len(begin)
    else:
        begin_index = 0
        
    if end in text:
        end_index = text.find(end)
    else:
        end_index = len(text)
        
    return text[begin_index:end_index]</pre>
        First of all, we're checking for the left marker in the text. If there isn't one, then the answer will start from the very beginning 
        of the input string. If there is one, then the answer will start with the character following the last character of the marker.
        After that we're checking for the right marker in the string. If there is one, we're making it the limit for our input string.
        If the input text doesn't contain the right marker, then the end of the input text will be the limit of our answer.

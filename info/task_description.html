    You are given a string and two markers (the initial and final). You have to find a substring enclosed between these two markers. But there are a few important conditions:
</p>

<p>This is a simplified version of mission <a href="/mission/between-markers/">Between Markers</a></p>

<ul>
	<li>The initial and final markers are always different.</li>
	<li>The initial and final markers are always 1 char size.</li>
	<li>The initial and final markers are always exist and go one after another.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Three arguments. All of them are strings. The second and third arguments are the initial and final markers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> A string.
